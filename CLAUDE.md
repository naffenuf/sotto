# CLAUDE.md

Sotto: a local web app that listens to a group brainstorm and contributes only when it matters. Built during the Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon (Oct 26 – Nov 4, 2026). Full spec: `tasks/prd-sotto-core.md`. Loop state: `ralph/prd.json`, `ralph/progress.txt`.

## Stack

Node 22 + TypeScript (strict), Fastify + `@fastify/websocket` in `server/`, React 18 + Vite in `web/`, shared types in `shared/`, Vitest. Meta Model API via the `openai` SDK with `baseURL: "https://api.meta.ai/v1"` and `MODEL_API_KEY` from `.env` (server only).

## Conventions

- All time-based server code uses the injected `Clock`, never `Date.now()`.
- Model prompts live in `server/prompts/*.md`.
- Model output is validated with zod.
- `npm test` makes no network calls; real-API tests go in `test:integration`.

## Learnings

(Iterations append durable patterns and gotchas here.)
